We are talking about the legacy companies working with legacy software legacy architecture and legacy things which makes task more messy or clustered by some means like analyzing data getting real time analysis connected connecting our product to user this is where digital transformation comes in and it fills the gap where the unwanted issues like load is failing And other technical difficulties which is managed by the host company In this case Google will do that like and the company will focus on it’s the cooler rented approach I’m making sure that customer is getting what they want so for the act accompanying play certain things.   

Firstly, we need to focus technical difficulties problem fixed by adopting cloud but rather than taking traditional IT infrastructure what does Google as developed something called a [Google Cloud adoption framework](https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework) which helps this process of migration bit easier.     

Secondly, six focus areas like talent, environment, structure, strategy, empowerment, and innovation need to be adopted as there will right structure so that it will make sure how to better work life balance office employees and also if employer has an idea they just don’t have to chat between them They would rather put up or to the their manager or the upper position and it will pass on and then later be integrated into the product if that idea is useful.

Thirdly, implement focus on the user, think 10X, launch and iterate business mindset in broader terms scale mindset of innovation so if the extent is focus on user is where employer also think of developing a function which also impact the user of the product and and think10x take the next mean like another thing the problem just for a shorter term but also think the problem here is going to encounter in long run and try to fix it nowadays by implementing right solution now and launch and iterate is there important thing as this helps to feel faster which means basically that we are not wasting time on wrong outcome apart from that using that time to implement the other way around to get to the goal.
