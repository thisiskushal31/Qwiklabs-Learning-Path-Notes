#### Digital Transformation with Google Cloud

Digital transformation steps in to fill the gap where unwelcome problems like load failure and other technical difficulties, which are managed by the host company, are present in legacy software architecture companies and makes tasks more messy or clustered by means like analysing data getting real-time analysis connected connecting our product to user. In this instance, companies like Google and AWS will work in this manner, and the business will concentrate on its other business strategy to ensure that the consumer is receiving what they desire not focusing on every little technical difficulty by on-prem servers.

***First and foremost***, we must concentrate on technical issues that can be resolved by adopting the cloud, but rather than using traditional IT infrastructure, Google has created something called [Google Cloud adoption framework](https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework) that makes this migration process a little bit simpler. The Google Cloud Adoption Framework helps you identify key activities and objectives that will reliably accelerate your cloud journey.

***Second***, six focus areas such as talent, environment, structure, strategy, empowerment, and innovation must be adopted as there will be the right structure to ensure better work-life balance in between office workers and creative and innovative in their environment and work as a team to improve product. 

***Third and final step***, *implement a focus on the user*, *think 10X*, *launch and iterate* mindset in employees
- *Focus on user*: If an employee thinks like how this feature impacts the user and how many users are willing to use this feature and how they gonna use it will make an application scalable and impactful.
- *Think 10X*: If an employee or manager thinks that a problem that would arise in 10 years or throughout a long period of time needs to be fixed, they should try to do so now by putting the proper solutions in place to make the application more effective in term of cloud architecture.
- *launch & iterate*: Simple terms, it meant to fail fast which means that the team is not wasting time to achieve results that don't help or improve the final product better instead, team recognise that we failed in what we are trying to achieve by doing it that way and we have to find another way around, which saves a lot of time, rather than wasting that and ending at deadlock after recognising that the team has wasted a lot of time in terms of cloud architecture and monetarily.
