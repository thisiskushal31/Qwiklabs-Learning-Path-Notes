#### Innovating with Data and Google Cloud

Business data is not a new term. Businesses have leveraged information about performance and operations for centuries to make decisions. Traditionally, data analysis could take days or months, is often incomplete, and complex reports were often done by specialized teams. Cloud technology disrupts traditional data analysis. Data can now be consumed, analyzed, and used at speed and scale never before possible.

In fact, businesses can now leverage cloud technology to ingest data in real time to train machine learning models and to take action.   
In this course, we're going to explore how businesses can better use data in their digital transformation journey.

In Module 1, I'll define data and its role in digital transformation. I'll identify where you can find data and how you can create new insights by combining different datasets.

In Module 2, I'll examine the differences and similarities between databases, data warehouses, and data lakes. I'll offer use cases for each and some relevant Google Cloud solutions for getting the most value from your data.

Finally, in Module 3, I'll look at machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'll highlight key opportunities for applying ML in any business and cover common Google Cloud ML and AI solutions that you can start using right away. Throughout the course, what I want you to remember is you don't have to be a data scientist or technical expert to do data analysis or to use machine learning.

In fact, with the right cloud tools, data is now accessible in new ways. Anyone in your organization can unlock the value of data to enable digital transformation.

#### Module 1 (The Value of Data)

Businesses now have access to data like never before. This includes internal information, data from inside your organization, and external information, customer and industry data. For example, as organizations have digitized their operations, all kinds of business data has become available, such as financial information, logistics data, production output, and quality reports. Businesses also have access to new kinds of data about their customers. Consider digital interactions such as the length of time a user spends on a web page or reaction to a social media post. These are totally new and very rich sources of information about customer behavior.
