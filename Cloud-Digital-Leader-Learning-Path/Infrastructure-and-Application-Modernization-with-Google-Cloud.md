#### Infrastructure and Application Modernization with Google Cloud

Consumer expectations over the last 20 years have radically changed. Customers now expect connected digital experiences in real time. Many businesses, especially large traditional enterprises, built their IT infrastructure on premises. Legacy systems and applications make up the organization's IT backbone. At the same time, these legacy systems and applications struggle to achieve the scale and speed needed to meet modern customer expectations. Business leaders and IT decision makers constantly have to choose between maintenance of legacy systems, and investing in innovative new products and services.   

In this course, I'll explore the challenges of an outdated IT infrastructure, and then describe how businesses can modernize that infrastructure using cloud technology.

In Module One, I'll introduce infrastructure modernization as the core topic, In particular, I'll examine compute options available in the cloud and the benefits of each. I'll also present a few Google cloud solutions and highlight customers who have successfully used them.

In Module Two, I'll focus on application modernization. Applications are not new in the cloud. But cloud technology enables businesses to develop, deploy, and update applications with speed, security and agility built it. I'll also cover App Engine, a Google Cloud solution that lets application developers build scalable web and mobile applications on a fully managed serverless platform.

In the third module, I'll present application programming interfaces, or APIs, and explain how they unlock value from legacy systems, enable businesses to create new value, and monetize new services. I'll also cover Apigee, a Google Cloud Platform for developing and managing APIs.
